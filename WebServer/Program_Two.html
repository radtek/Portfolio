<h3> Overview: </h3>

All MyWebserver programs MUST communicate with the <strong>  Firefox </strong> browser.<p>

In this program you will follow through the steps of capturing the http
stream between existing clients and servers, and write a web server that
supports this same protocol. It builds on the JokeServer, which application
does much of the same work. While the text of the assignment is quite long,
the application itself is quite straightforward, and you might be surprised
at how easily it can be written.</p><p>

There are four+ phases in the development process:
</p><ol>
<li> Capture the HTTP protocol first-hand by developing some hacking /
debugging skills (hacking in the good sense).<p>
</p></li><li> Return simple, static files on request from a browser client.<p>
</p></li><li> Return dynamically created HTML (build a directory HTML page
dynamically)<p>
</p></li><li> Accept FORM input from the user and do back-end processing on the
server to return computed values in (simple!) dynamically-created HTML.<p>
</p></li><li> Add features of your own choosing, if you like.<p>
</p></li></ol>


<p>

See the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mywebserver/tips.html"> MyWebServer Tips </a> file for some
suggestions once you get coding.</p><p>

</p><h3> Run at port 2540 in the server directory! </h3>

In all cases these following specifications take precedence: The web server
must run at port http://localhost:2540. It must, by default, serve files
<strong> from the directory in which the web server is started,</strong> including dog.txt,
cat.html. The source code should be contained in a single,
stand-alone file name MyWebServer.java ready to compile and
run. Subdirectories should be recursed from the default directory in which
the server is started. <p>


</p><h3> Special Security Note! </h3> 

I expect that you will find that this is not a particularly difficult
assignment. If so, you will soon have a viable, running, webserver of your
own creation. If you are developing on a machine that is also connected to
the internet this means that you might well expose all of the files on your
local machine (or any remote machine where you might be running) to evil
hackers from around the world who are anxious to steal information from your
files. In the worst case this information would allow them write access to
your disk, and/or put financial/personal information in their hands. So --
be careful. Hard-code into your server that you only return files from your
root server directory of unimportant files, keep your firewall on,
etc. Becareful about the "../.." form of URLs, which would allow someone to
retrieve files from above your server's directory. For particularly
sensitive machines you can always simply <strong> unplug your internet
connection </strong>
while running your server.

<p>

<!--
<h3> Wireless Markup Language </h3>

All references to WML and lion.wml are strictly optional. Newer markup
languages for use with WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) are making this
an outdated technology. See <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language>
Wikipedia WML </a>
-->

</p><h3> Server Directories </h3>

For this assignment your server must serve files from the <strong> directory where
the server is started. </strong><p>

Unix (Apache) servers usually serve files from
<i> USERACCOUNT/public_html.</i> For example, if I put dog.txt on this unix/Apache machine
as <i> /condor/cscfclt/elliott/public_html/dog.txt </i> we would find it on
the web as <i> http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/dog.txt.</i>



</p><h3> Administration: </h3>


<ul>

<li> Submission files: <strong> MyWebServer.java,
http-streams.txt, serverlog.txt, checklist-mywebserver.html </strong> <p>

</p></li><li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mywebserver/checklist-mywebserver.html"> checklist </a> for this
programming assignment. Turn it in to D2L along with your assignment. Fill in the blanks. Update it as
you make progress. NEVER change yes to no, unless you have completed the work.<p>

</p></li><li> Zip your your sfiles into one, flat, directory, and submit to D2L (No
subdirectories!) Verify that your submission has not been corrupted. <p>

</p></li><li> Concatenate  MyWebServer.java, http-streams.txt, serverlog.txt into a
single text file and submit to MyWebserverTII at D2L <p>

</p></li><li> <strong>"javac *.java" </strong> must work to compile your source code.<p>

</p></li><li> Make sure that you are familiar with the assignment submission rules
(see assignment one, which covers this in detail). Programs that do not
precisely conform to the rules will not be graded. Please do not ask for an
exception to this policy.<p>


</p></li><li> Your websever
must, by default, serve directories, and files, from the directory in which
it runs so that I can test it. If you want also to implement something more
sophisticated, then use a flag in your code, but set the flag to the default
directory for me before submitting.<p>

</p></li><li> Refer to the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/inet/InetClientServer.pdf"> InetServer PDF </a> document, and the
lecture, for the basic program on which you build. Most of you will have
completed this assignment, and extended it, well in advance of the
MyWebServer program.<p>

<!--
<li> All students have unix accounts on <strong> students.depaul.edu </strong>. You
can get access to your account from the ID Card Services office, or by
checking with the helpdesk at (312) 362-8765 (you will need your student ID
number). Apparently, currently, these are the only two options. It is not
essential that you activate your student unix account on students.depaul.edu, but it might help
make the assignment easier. Please post tips to the newsgroup forums -- access procedures change all the time! <p> 

See <a href=cdmlinux.html> CDM Linux Machines </a> for alternative access to
linux.<p>

See <a href=http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/shared/students-web.html>
Creating Unix Web Files </a> for basic web file creation.<p> -->

</p></li></ul>

<h3> Capturing HTTP: </h3>

<ul>

<li> Goal: Be hackers in the good sense... See what a Web browser, and a
webserver are saying to one another for simple browser requests, so that you
can later copy that functionality into your own server program.<p>

</p></li><li> Note that you can use WireShark (see the labs) to capture these streams, as an
alternative to the hacking methods below.<p>

</p></li><li> Copy your InetServer.java source (or your jokeserver) to a file called
MyListener.java. Modify, and simplify, the code so that it simply displays
everything sent to it on the server console, and to a log file. Have it send back a valid
ascii-based response to the client, acknowledging receipt of the "request" (
but note that this is just some minor elegance, not really needed).<p>

That is, if the client sends the message, "ABC Hello there in Server land! <xyz>"
then the server will display the message "ABC Hello there in Server land! <xyz> "
on the server console, and optionally may send some message such as "Got your request"
back to the client. (If you don't return a message, the browser will just
hang, but we don't care.) </xyz></xyz></p><p>

You now have a simple "listener" program which echos all input on the server
console .</p><p>

If you want to be fancy, your MyListener program can, in addition to the
console display, also send all of the information back to the client as
HTML-formatted data. This is not required, and note that you will have to
send back the corrent MIME type for HMTL: "Content-Type: text/html [cr/lf]
[cr/lf]" (see below). </p><p>

</p></li><li> Start MyListener and connect to it with Firefox as follows:
Make valid webserver
requests of MyListener by entering URLS such as
http://localhost:2540/elliott/dog.txt, and
http://localhost:2540/elliott/cat.html.
Notice, and record, what the
browser sends your MyListener program in each case (it is displayed on the
server console). This is the HTTP stream that the browser sends when it is
requesting files from a web server. You have now hacked it.<p>

</p></li><li> Capture the console output from MyListener into some file as well (or cut from
the console window and paste into a file), for submission as
part of the assignment.<p>

</p></li><li> Note that the port number is whatever you have chosen for your
MyListener (where mine happened to be 2540—but note that 2540 is also used
for the MyWebServer program), and the namestring should be whatever the name
is for your unix account (where mine happens to be elliott). [This step has
nothing to do with any unix machines; we are just entering a unix-style URL
with a user name to see how that gets sent to a server.]<p>

</p></li><li> For example, following the above procedure, while running my listener
at port 2540, I get the following information for a request of dog.txt in
the (hypothetical) root web server directory for the user elliott:
<pre> 
C:\dp\435\java&gt;java MyListener

Clark Elliott's Port listener running at 2540.

GET /elliott/dog.txt HTTP/1.1
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, application/x-shockwave-flash, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: localhost:2540
Connection: Keep-Alive

(Note: you may wish to experiment with "Connection: close" with your
webserver if you are having buffering problems.)

</pre>


</li><li> Put this captured output into http-streams.txt for submission with the
assignment.<p>

</p></li><li> We are now going to use the HTTP stream we have just captured to
manually retrieve files from a web server.<p>

</p><ol> 

<li> For those that have accounts on students.depaul.edu, log in to that
machine and place files in your /public_html subdirectory. Or you can
retrieve files from my faculty account at:<br> <br>

<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/dog.txt">
condor.depaul.edu/elliott/dog.txt </a> <br><br>

<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/lion.html"> condor.depaul.edu/elliott/lion.html </a> <br><br>

Or, if you have a webserver on your PC you can just use that. Or you can
install the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/miniserver/">
SourceForge Mini Server </a> and run that.

<p>

</p></li><li> Note: Tech support has been moving my directories around. If elliott
does not work, try it with a tilde (~elliott).<p>

</p></li><li> Verify that the files are accessible from the web on
condor.depaul.edu/elliott, or students.depaul.edu/YourUsername (or your other webserver) by
retrieving dog and cat with a web browser.<p>

</p></li><li> Either use Wireshark, or create a MyTelnet.java program by modifying
your InetClient, or JokeClient, so that it allows you to type in an
arbitrary text string, and send this (via port 80) to a web server. Write
all input and output for your MyTelnet to a log file, for later submission
to D2L, but I don't need to see your source code for this simple program.<p>

</p></li><li> Use your MyTelnet program to manually enter into a dialog with the

condor.depaul.edu (or some other) web server.


We are working with students.depaul.edu for convenience, and just
happen to be connecting to the web server that is running on the students machine, because
that is where we put our files. However, we could just as easily
 manually get files from the web server at www.cnn.com if they were on that machine.<p>

You will connect at port 80 instead of the default telnet port of 23,
because you want to talk to the web server, instead of the telnet server.</p><p>

Do this by entering the shell command, 

</p><pre>MyTelnet condor.depaul.edu 80   &lt;-- or whichever server you are using
</pre>

The condor.depaul.edu web server is now waiting for input from you.<p>

You can use the following static files in the step below, or similar files
that you have created on your own webserver, or in your own account:

</p><pre>http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/cat.html 
http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/dog.txt
</pre>

<ul>
<li> Enter the valid HTTP request stream that you captured using your
listener, for retrieving the file dog.txt from a web server. Note that you
will have to be careful to include all of the necessary information,
including carriage return / linefeeds (cr/lfs), and that you will have to
make changes as needed for different servers. You could probably use cut
and paste if you were clever, but unless you connect many times it is
probably not worth it. <p>

Hint: some of the information, such as the "Accept" and "User-Information"
info is not needed by the web server, and you can find this through
experimentation. </p><p>

</p></li><li> If you enter the HTTP correctly the web server will now send your
requested file back to you as a text stream response to your MyTelnet
client. If you enter it incorrectly you will still usually get some kind of
valid response, albeit one containing an error message.<p>

</p></li><li> Here is a sample session, yours will be similar, but may differ in some
of the details, depending which webserver you are using, on which machine:

<pre> 

&gt; MyTelnet condor.depaul.edu 80

GET /elliott/dog.txt HTTP/1.1    [&lt;-- I am typing this into the console window manually]
Host: condor.depaul.edu:80

[Elliott note: two carriage return / linefeeds (crlfs)  go here.]
</pre> 

and we get back the response something like the following:

<pre> 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 16 Sep 2005 18:09:38 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.53  HP-UX_Apache-based_Web_Server (Unix) PHP/4.3.8
Last-Modified: Fri, 16 Sep 2005 18:08:50 GMT
ETag: "5e1c1-2f-7c517080"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 47
Content-Type: text/plain

This is Elliott's dog file on condor and hawk.
Connection closed by foreign host.

&gt; 
</pre>  <p>
</p></li></ul>

</li><li> Put this captured output into http-streams.txt for submission with the
assignment.<p>

</p></li><li> [Note: Firefox allows you to download and install a plug-in called HTTPFox (tools -&gt; add-ons -&gt; get
add-ons).  After HTTPFox is installed you'll see a small icon in the
bottom right corner of your browser window.  With HTTPFox you will be able
to see all outgoing traffic from your web browser, as well as all of the
server responses coming back. (Similar to Fiddler for IE) (Thanks Arkadiusz)] <p>


</p></li><li> So, in summary: Create the simple files dog.txt, cat.html,
in your home web directory (or use my files). Verify that they can be reached from the
web. Retrieve your files manually using MyTelnet to port 80.<p>


</p></li><li> You have now captured both the request coming from a web client, and the
response coming from a web server. Ta-duh.<p>

</p></li></ol></li></ul>

<h3> Modify your MultiThreaded server so that it becomes a simple web
server.</h3>

Goal: Your web server must correctly return requests for files with
extensions of .txt, and .html.  This means that it must return the
correct MIME headers (That is, the Content-type [followed by two cr/lf], and
Content-length headers), as well as the data. This is a server that operates
on static data.

<ul> 

<li> Copy your MyListener.java source into a file called MyWebServer.java.<p>

</p></li><li> Copy over your files dog.txt, cat.html to your local
machine into the directory where you are developing your web server, for later use.<p>

</p></li><li> Using the manual responses you captured from the web server (see above),
which contains ALL of the information that the web server sends back to a
client, including, specifically the MIME type information (Content type) and
content length, modify your listener so that it becomes a valid web server
by sending back a valid text stream, including headers, to the web client.
See <a a="" href="http://en.kioskea.net/contents/internet/http.php3"> HTTP
protocol </a> for some hints.<p>

</p></li><li> In practice you need not send back all of the responses. You WILL want
to include:
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 47  [Where 47 is changed to the real length of the data --
     but note that you might make initial tests by just setting this value high]
Content-Type: text/plain  [Where text/plain might also be: text/html]

</pre>

[followed by two carriage return / linefeeds (crlf), and then the data.]<p>

Here is a favicon file:</p><p>

 <img src="./Program_Two_files/favicon.ico" alt="v1"> which modern browsers tend
to look for. If you put this in your server's root directory it may solve
problems for you. Here is the WikiPedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon"> 
favicons </a> </p><p>


The following end of line hints might be useful:

</p><pre> static final byte[] EOL = {(byte) '\r', (byte) '\n'};

or:

outstream.writeBytes("Content-Type: " + ConType + "\r\n\r\n");

or:

outstream.print("\r\n\r\n");

</pre>

</li><li> Configure your sever so that it sends back the correct MIME type
headers for .txt, and .html files [text/plain, and text/html, respectively].<p>

<!--
<li> OPTIONAL: Download and install the <a href="./mywebserver/upsdkW41e.exe"> phone
 browser </a> (a simulated cell phone) to see that your .wml files are
 returned correctly. Note: I *strongly* recommend that you use this older,
 out-of-date, version for our small project because it is about 1/10th the
 size of the current version, and yet meets all our needs. Note: this is
 about a fifteen second installation. Type the URL of your web server .wml
 file into the phone browser, and see if it works. You may need to clear the
 cache from time to time, and/or reboot the phone browser if it gets
 confused. Tip: if you have a real web-enabled cell phone, your server will
 serve these files to it. Try it!<p>
-->

</p></li><li> Use your MyListener, and the MyTelnet trick, for debugging as needed.
</li></ul>

<h3> Extend your server to include directories: </h3>


Goal: Extend your server so that it sends back dynamically constructed data:
in this case the HTML-formatted current contents of a directory.
This is now a server that operates on <i> dynamic </i> data.

<ul>

<li> Note: The DePaul webservers no longer allow the promiscuous display of
a directory's contents. But we will still provide it from our server.<p>

</p></li><li> See the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mywebserver/ReadFiles.java"> ReadFiles.java </a>
program for hints on how to read the contents of a directory in Java.
[Note: a directory is simply a more-or-less regular file that contains the
names of other files in it, along with some associated information.]<p>


</p></li><li> Modify your webserver so that it correctly returns a promiscuous
display of the server's directory as requested by the client. Note that
you may want to include some security here, since you WILL be writing
a valid, albeit simple, web server. For example, you might want to restrict
access to a certain subdirectory of where the server is running.<p>
</p><ol>
<li> The first step is to simply send back an ascii (txt) listing of the
files in the directory, along with a text/plain MIME header, and the
length of your data.<p>

</p></li><li> The second step is to send back some kind of formatted HTML with
a text/html MIME header.<p>

</p></li><li> The third step (really not that hard) is send back the names of the
files as hot-link references such that "clicking-on" them in the browser
will cause your server to send back the contents of that file.<p>
</p></li></ol><p>

</p></li><li> Using your telnet http hack, see what a regular server sends back as an
html listing of hot-links for files. For example, for the condor.depaul.edu
request "GET /elliott/435/.xyz/" condor [used to send back] the following:

<pre>
[...]
&lt;h1&gt;Index of /elliott/435/.xyz&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;img src="/icons/blank.gif" alt="Icon "&gt; &lt;a href="?C=N;O=D"&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;                    &lt;a href="?C=M;O=A"&gt;Last modified&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;a href="?C=S;O=A"&gt;Size&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="?C=D;O=A"&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img src="/icons/back.gif" alt="[DIR]"&gt; &lt;a href="/elliott/435/"&gt;Parent Directory&lt;/a&gt;                             -   
&lt;img src="/icons/text.gif" alt="[TXT]"&gt; &lt;a href="first-file.txt"&gt;first-file.txt&lt;/a&gt;          16-Sep-2005 14:09   39   
&lt;img src="/icons/text.gif" alt="[TXT]"&gt; &lt;a href="second-file.html"&gt;second-file.html&lt;/a&gt;        16-Sep-2005 14:09   67   
&lt;img src="/icons/text.gif" alt="[TXT]"&gt; &lt;a href="third-file.wml"&gt;third-file.wml&lt;/a&gt;          16-Sep-2005 14:09  222   
&lt;img src="/icons/folder.gif" alt="[DIR]"&gt; &lt;a href="z-directory/"&gt;z-directory/&lt;/a&gt;            16-Sep-2005 15:08    -   
&lt;/pre&gt;

</pre>

Which displays as:

We can simplify this as follows:

<pre>
&lt;pre&gt; 

&lt;h1&gt;Index of /elliott/435/.xyz&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href="/elliott/435/"&gt;Parent Directory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="z-directory/"&gt;z-directory/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

</pre>

Which displays as:

</pre>

<hr> 

</li><li> Lastly, modify the return from your server so that it sends back links to
subdirectories as subdirectory hot links, if you have not already done
so. The only hard part is identifying a file as a directory, and typically
you can look for a trailing slash ("/").<p>

</p></li><li> For some browsers, and browser settings, you may have some difficulties
with the directories -- e.g., you might have to send your request twice.
Remember that you may be able to capture your request, and use MyListener as
a debugger. Also, you might want to experiment with:
Connection: Keep-Alive / Connection: close.<p>

</p></li><li> Also, you may want to experiment with the socket.close() method if your
browser is not displaying the data but all else is working.<p>

</p></li><li> You should now have a relatively complete, working, web server, that
can return correct MIME types for different types of files, recurse
subdirectories, and return dynamically-created html. Because it is
multi-threaded it should be able to handle many hundreds of requests. Good
work!<p>

<h3> Server-Side scripting and program execution. </h3>

Goal: write simple code to run arbitrary program code on the server processing user
input from the web, and send the results back to the web client.<p>

In this section we add back-end programming capability to your server, or at
least simulate it. We create a simple <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/mywebserver/addnums.html">
addnums web form </a>, accept input from a user, pass this to our webserver,
process the information, and return a computed response based on the
input. </p><p>

For those who are more ambitious, here is a starting link on java's JNI,
which allows us to call native code, by loading it into the virtual machine,
and then running it. <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/JDCBook/jniexamp.html">
Sun JNI example.</a> In this way we might write programs that actually
run arbitrary scripts/programs under the web server.</p><p>

Alternatively, for those writing in C, the "system()" function will execute
any executables as subprocesses, making the running of programs and scripts
trival. Note: be <strong> very </strong> security conscious of running
user-input shell commands with the "system()" call, because, e.g., they
might have you execute a command to erase all of your files!

</p><p>

Neither method is required. Instead, to keep the programming scope
reasonable, we will only <i> simulate </i> the running of back-end scripts.</p><p>


CGI (the Common Gateway Interface) has been around since the beginning of
the web, so there are thousands of references on how to use it.

</p><ul>

<li> Use the given web form that accepts a name and two numbers. On the "action"
statement, using the GET method, call a program with the extension
".fake-cgi" with a URL that points to your MyWebServer program. E.g., you
might have...

<pre>&lt;FORM METHOD="GET" ACTION="http://localhost:2540/cgi/addnums.fake-cgi"&gt;<p>
</p></pre>

...which would suggest that you have a script in the /cgi subdirectory of your
server, named addnums.fake-cgi that will handle the input from the current
HTML form.<p>

</p></li><li> Note: Although method = POST is more common, GET is a little simpler, and will suit
our needs just fine.<p>

</p></li><li> In your webserver, note that the file extension is .fake-cgi. Instead
of looking for a file with this extension as you would for .txt and .html
treat the input to the server as input to a script. In a regular server you
would follow the rules of the <i> Common Gateway Interface </i> (hence CGI)
to call a script or executable, and pass it the input, then return the result. In our case we will
simply handle the input in the server itself.<p>

</p></li><li> Use your MyListener program to see what the browser is sending when the
form is submitted. Note where attribute-value pairs (for num1, num2, and
person) are located. Design your method for parsing the input from what the
browser is sending you.  For exmple, for form-input of "Matilda," and the
numbers 4 and 5, you would expect the following to show up in your input
stream:
<pre> 

GET /cgi/addnums.fake-cgi?person=Matilda&amp;num1=4&amp;num2=5 HTTP/1.1
</pre>

</li><li> Parse the input according to the rules of CGI for GET.<p>


</p></li><li> Call a method addnums() in your server to handle the input and return the
HTML formatted output to the client, using the correct MIME type,
content-length, etc. Note that you must be careful that the working memory
for each invocation of addnums() is distinct from all other
invocations. Your multi-threaded server may be processing many requests at
once.<p>

</p></li><li> Send back an HTML page that returns the user's name and also the sum of
the two numbers. E.g., "Dear Matilda, the sum of 4 and 5 is 9."<p>

</p></li><li> For debugging purposes, always remember that you can send the form to your
MyListener program to see exactly what the browser is sending you.<p>

</p></li></ul>

Tu-duh! You have now built a multi-threaded web server that can handle files,
directory traversals, and server-side scripting (of sorts).

<h3> What you turn in </h3>

<ul> 
<li> Capture the HTTP stream from a client using your MyListener Program.
Capture the HTTP stream from a server using your MyTelent program.
Concatenate these streams together, adding header, or in-line comments as
needed or helpful, about what the file contains, and put it in a file
called <strong> http-streams.txt. </strong> <p>

</p></li><li> Produce simple "debugging" console output from your webserver showing a
series of connections that have been made, what the request string is
(dumping the first, informative, characters of the GET request is fine ---
no editing needed), and the file names that were returned. Rough output is
fine, just showing the general working of your server. Then remove the
debugging output if you like. Or, you can produce a log file if you
wish. Put the text of this log, along with clearly-delineated explanatory
comments as needed or helpful, in a file <strong> serverlog.txt. </strong> <p>

</p></li><li> Put all of your source code into a <i> single </i> file named <strong>
MyWebServer.java </strong>, include the standard header comments, and make
sure it compiles and runs. Your server <strong> MUST </strong> serve files
from the subdirectory in which it is started.<p>

</p></li><li> Do NOT submit either MyListener.java or MyTelnet.java. These were for
your own utility use, and the worker methods might present a conflict with
MyWebServer.java compilation.<p>

</p></li><li> Fill in your <strong> checklist-mywebserver.html</strong> file
representing what you have done. NEVER change a "no" to a "yes" without
having completed that portion of the assignment! (See the academic integrity
link.)<p>

</p></li><li> Put everything IN ONE DIRECTORY. No subdirectories. Make sure that you
do not have a conflict with the worker methods of MyListener, and MyWebServer.<p>

</p></li><li> Collect the four files (possibly more if bragging rights) into a .zip file, and submit to D2L before the
due date.<p>

</p></li><li> Concatenate all your files except the checklist into a single text file and submit to TurnItIn.com<p>

</p></li><li> Good work!

</li></ul>

<h3> Grading note: </h3>

We MUST be able to retrieve files from the directory in which your
MyWebserver program is running. That is, when the following files are
together in the indicated subdirectory:

<pre> 
/users/elliott/students/435/Web/
    MyWebserver.class
    dog.txt
    lion.html
    /sub-a
       /sub-b
          lion.html
</pre>

We should be able to retrieve your files from:

<pre>http://localhost:2540/dog.txt
http://localhost:2540/lion.html
http://localhost:2540/sub-a/sub-b/lion.html

</pre>

and

<pre>http://localhost:2540/ or...
http://localhost:2450
</pre>

should show us:

<pre>addnums.html
checklist-mywebserver.html
dog.txt
http-streams.txt
lion.html
serverlog.txt
sub-a/
MyWebserver.class
MyWebServer.java
</pre>

...or at least something similar.<p>

It is very much appreciated if we can
grade your <i> http-streams.txt</i> and <i>checklist-mywebserver.html</i> files directly in the
browser using your MyWebserver program to serve the files!


</p><h3> Bragging rights (not required): </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Store the MIME types in a table of MIME types and file
extensions. Read the table in when the server starts, and also again, while
the server is running, if a file extension is not recognized. This way,
adding a new MIME type is as simple as adding an entry in your table, and
putting files with that extension in your directory. Be SURE that your
MimeTypes file is included in your submission and note this in your
comments.html file and at the top of your MyWebserver.html file. <p>

</p></li><li> Bragging rights: HTTP has components for storing cookies on the client
through the browser. Implement this, and write a small application that
shows this interaction with your server such that the cookie is sent back to
the server by the browser on a later invocation.<p>

</p></li><li> Bragging rights: implement a security policy for your server. This can
become major bragging rights, depending on how far you go.<p>

</p></li><li> Major bragging rights: Implement all of the above using HTTPS as well
as HTTP. (Note: this is hard.)<p>

</p></li><li> Major bragging rights (not recommended): Implement true, if limited,
CGI capability by spawing subprocesses to execute back-end programs in real
scripting languages. But note: this is actually quite simple if you write
your webserver in a native language like C, or PERL, which supports the
direct spawning of shell processes on the local machine.<p>

</p></li></ul>
